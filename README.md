- [EasyUI](https://github.com/djalbat/EasyUI) A V-framework.

## Installation

You can install EasyUI-DragAndDrop with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    npm install easyui-draganddrop

You can also clone the repository with [Git](https://git-scm.com/)...

    git clone https://github.com/djalbat/EasyUI-DragAndDrop.git

...and then install the necessary modules with npm from within the project's root directory:

    npm install

You will need to do this if you want to look at the examples.

## Usage

If you're building with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) the usage is as follows:

```js
var easyuidraganddrop = require('easyui-draganddrop'),
    Explorer = easyuidraganddrop.Explorer,
    RubbishBin = easyuidraganddrop.RubbishBin;
```

To use EasyUI-DragAndDrop in the browser, take the `easyui-draganddrop.js` file from the project's `dist/` folder and put it somewhere such as a `public/scripts/lib` directory. Referencing this distribution file from a `script` element...

```html
<script src="scripts/lib/easyui-draganddrop.js"> </script>
```

...will give you a global `easyuidraganddrop` variable which can be used directly:

```js
var Explorer = easyuidraganddrop.Explorer,
    RubbishBin = easyuidraganddrop.RubbishBin;
```

Note the lack of a hyphen.

Alternatively, if you're using an AMD style `require` the usage is similar to the Node.js case, only make sure that the path to the distribution file is correct. The following script should work, assuming it lives in the the `public/scripts/` directory:

```js
var easyuidraganddrop = require('lib/easyui-draganddrop'),
    Explorer = easyuidraganddrop.Explorer,
    RubbishBin = easyuidraganddrop.RubbishBin;
```

## Compiling from source

Automation is done with [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts), have a look at the `package.json` file. The pertinent commands are:

    npm run build-debug
    npm run watch-debug

## Examples

See the `examples.html` file in the project's root directory, or read on.

### Creating instances

See the `example.html` file in the `docs/` folder for an example. 

You must include the `easyui-draganddrop.html` and `easyui-draganddrop.css` files in the `dist/` directory or their contents somehow in your application as well as the four PNG files. The HTML snippet in the `easyui-draganddrop.html` file includes an `img` element to preload the `marker.png` file. You may need to adjust the relative URL.

Creating instances can be done with constructors:

```js
var explorer = new Explorer('#explorer', Explorer, onActivate, onMove),
    rubbishBin = new RubbishBin('#rubbishBin', onRemove);
```

### Cloning or creating instances from HTML

You can also create instances using the `clone()` factory or instance methods. Remember to remove the `id` attribute if you've used the `clone()` factory method and the jQuery selector used it. Or you can use the `fromHTML()` methods, as in the examples: 

```js
var firstExplorer = Explorer.fromHTML('<ul class="first explorer"> </ul>', 'First explorer', onActivate, onMove),
    secondExplorer = Explorer.fromHTML('<ul class="second explorer"> </ul>', 'Second explorer', onActivate, onMove),
    rubbishBin = RubbishBin.fromHTML('<div class="rubbishBin"> </div>', onRemove);

var body = new Body();

body.append(firstExplorer);
body.append(secondExplorer);
body.append(rubbishBin);
```

Remember when cloning or creating from HTML that you actually then attach the explorer to an existing DOM element.

### Adding and removing files and directories

You can add files or empty directories:

```js
secondExplorer.addDirectory('Second explorer/First directory');
secondExplorer.addDirectory('Second explorer/Second directory');

secondExplorer.addFile('Second explorer/First directory/First file.fls');
secondExplorer.addFile('Second explorer/First directory/Second file.fls');
secondExplorer.addFile('Second explorer/Second directory/Third file.fls');
```

The `addDirectory()` method has a second, optional `collapsed` argument. The default is `false`. The explorer will add the necessary parent directories for you whenever you add a file. If you try to add a file or directory more than once, nothing happens.

You can remove files and non-empty directories:

```js
secondExplorer.removeFile('Second explorer/First directory/Second file.fls', true);
secondExplorer.removeFile('Second explorer/Second directory/Third file.fls', false);

secondExplorer.removeDirectory('Second explorer/Second directory', false);
```

You cannot remove the topmost directory, and if you try to remove a file or directory more than once, nothing happens.

### Dragging between elements

Use the `addDroppableElement()` method to have one element listen for the dragging events of another.

```js
firstExplorer.addDroppableElement(secondExplorer);
secondExplorer.addDroppableElement(firstExplorer);
firstExplorer.addDroppableElement(rubbishBin);
secondExplorer.addDroppableElement(rubbishBin);
```

Here the rubbish bin will listen for dragging events from both of the explorers. Each of the explorers will listen for dragging events of the other's.

### Activating files

This is done by double clicking on them, in which case the `onActivate` handler is called with the file's source path. A callback is passed as a second argument. If this is invoked with `false` or if the handler explicitly returns `false`, the file will be removed.

```js
function onActivate(sourcePath, callback) {
  console.log('activate: ' + sourcePath)

  switch(sourcePath) {
    case 'Second explorer/Second directory/Third file.fls':
      callback(false);
      break;
  }
}
```

### Handling moving files and directories

The `onMove()` handler is invoked with an array of path maps and a `done` argument. You must call the `done()` method when you are done. Each element of the array of path maps is a mutable object with one key, namely the entry's source path. Its value is the entry's target path. If you want the entry to be moved, leave the object as-is. If you want the entry to be left in place, change the value to the source path. If you want it removed, change the value to `null`. Simply leaving the array of path maps alone with therefore move the entries as expected.

```js
function onMove(pathMaps, done) {
  pathMaps.forEach(function(pathMap) {
    var pathMapKeys = Object.keys(pathMap),
        firstPathMapKey = first(pathMapKeys),
        sourcePath = firstPathMapKey, ///
        targetPath = pathMap[sourcePath],
        movedPath = targetPath;

    console.log('move file: ' + sourcePath + ' -> ' + targetPath)

    switch(sourcePath) {
      case 'Second explorer/First directory/First file.fls':
        console.log('...deleted.')

        movedPath = null;
        break;

      case 'Second explorer/First directory/Second file.fls':
      case 'Second explorer/First directory':
        console.log('...left in place.')

        movedPath = sourcePath;
        break;
    }

    pathMap[sourcePath] = movedPath;
  });

  done();
}
```
   
### Handling removing files and directories
  
The `onRemove()` handler is invoked with an array of path maps and a `done` argument. You must call the `done()` method when you are done. Each element of the array of path maps is a mutable object with one key, namely the entries source path. If you want the entry to be removed, leave the object as-is. If you want the entry to be left in place, change the value to the target path. Simply leaving the array of path maps alone will therefore remove the entries as expected.

```js
function onRemove(pathMaps, done) {
  pathMaps.forEach(function(pathMap) {
    var pathMapKeys = Object.keys(pathMap),
        firstPathMapKey = first(pathMapKeys),
        sourcePath = firstPathMapKey, ///
        removedPath = null;

    console.log('remove file: ' + sourcePath)

    switch(sourcePath) {
      case 'Second explorer/First directory/Second file.fls':
      case 'Second explorer/First directory':
        console.log('...left in place.')

        removedPath = sourcePath;
        break;
    }

    pathMap[sourcePath] = removedPath;
  });

  done();
}
```

You can check to see if the source path is that of the explorer's root directory in which case you can remove the whole explorer if you wish.

```js
if (sourcePath === 'First explorer') {
  console.log('...removing entire explorer.')

  secondExplorer.removeDroppableElement(firstExplorer);

  firstExplorer.remove();
}
```

## Changing the CSS

Feel free to change the CSS with care. Check the `example.css` file in the `docs/` folder for some CSS that works well. Note that the triangles used are defined in the `ToggleButton` class in the `es6/explorer/` folder. You'll need to re-build the package if you want to change these.
